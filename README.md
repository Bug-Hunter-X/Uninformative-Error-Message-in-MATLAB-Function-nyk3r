# Uninformative Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue in MATLAB where error messages are not very descriptive, hindering debugging efforts.  The `bug.m` file contains a function that throws a generic error when a negative input is supplied. The improved version in `bugSolution.m` provides a more helpful error message with context.
